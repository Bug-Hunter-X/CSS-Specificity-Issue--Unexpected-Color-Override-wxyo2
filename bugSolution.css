The solution involves understanding and correctly applying CSS specificity:

**Option 1:  Adjusting Specificity**

If the intent is to have `color: red` applied universally, remove the more specific selector:

```css
p {
  color: red; 
}
```

**Option 2:  Using !important (Less Recommended)**

Using `!important` is generally discouraged because it can lead to difficult-to-debug conflicts, but it can override specificity:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red !important; 
}
```

**Option 3:  Adding a more specific selector (more specific than `div p`):**

If the `color: blue` is the intended behavior, leave the selector as is. Or, add a more specific selector that takes precedence.

```css
div.container p{
 color:blue
}
```
