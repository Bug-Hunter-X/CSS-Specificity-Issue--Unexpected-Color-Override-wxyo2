The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red; 
}
```

In this scenario, both selectors target the `<p>` element. However, the selector `div p` is more specific because it targets a `<p>` element that is a direct descendant of a `<div>` element.  Therefore, even if the `<p>` element is nested within a `<div>`, the `color: blue` declaration will take precedence due to this higher specificity, potentially overriding the intended `color: red`.
